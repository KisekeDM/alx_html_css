    <h2>Introduction: The Dual Nature of Religion</h2>
    <p>Religion plays a significant role in many people’s lives, offering comfort, purpose, and community. However, while it often supports mental well-being, certain religious teachings and environments can also contribute to psychological distress. The relationship between religion and mental health is complex and varies depending on individual beliefs, religious practices, and social context.</p>

    <h2>Religious Guilt and Shame</h2>
    <h3>Internal Conflict and Self-Worth</h3>
    <p>One way religion can depreciate mental health is through the promotion of guilt and shame. Doctrines that frame natural human behaviors—such as sexuality, doubt, or anger—as sinful may cause individuals to internalize feelings of unworthiness. This chronic guilt can lead to anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem, especially when adherents feel they are constantly falling short of spiritual expectations.</p>

    <h2>Social Isolation and Stigmatization</h2>
    <h3>Exclusion and Judgment from Religious Communities</h3>
    <p>Some religious communities maintain rigid boundaries about who belongs and who doesn't, which can result in the social exclusion of individuals who question beliefs or live in ways that differ from traditional teachings. People who identify as LGBTQ+, for example, may face rejection or forced silence within their communities, increasing their risk of mental health struggles such as loneliness, identity suppression, and trauma.</p>

    <h2>Suppression of Mental Health Treatment</h2>
    <h3>Over Therapy?</h3>
    <p>In certain religious traditions, mental health challenges are seen as spiritual weaknesses or consequences of a lack of faith. This belief can prevent individuals from seeking professional help, relying instead on prayer or spiritual healing. While faith can be a powerful coping tool, dismissing therapy or medication in favor of solely spiritual solutions may delay proper treatment and worsen mental health conditions.</p>
